# You can retrieve a web page element from a BeautifulSoup object by calling
# the select()method and passing a string of a CSS selector for the element you
# are looking for. Selectors are like regular expressions: they specify a pattern
# to look forâ€”in this case, in HTML pages instead of general text strings.


# # CSS Selector passed to the select() method Will match . . .
