# Natural Language Processing (NLP). No other field has been as profoundly transformed by AI in recent years as NLP.
# These LLMs, the cutting-edge tools in this domain (NLP), are what I will explore with you in this project.

## Enable Applications To:
     >> capable of generating text
	 >> translating it
	 >> creating text from images
	 >> and producing human-level responses
	 
## Initially, LLMs were tools reserved for experts. 
##         However, the release of ChatGPT in late 2022 transformed public access to AI. 
##         Suddenly, anyone could interact with an LLM through a simple interface.
